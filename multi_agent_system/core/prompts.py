        2. Action: Execute one of your available tools using the exact format shown below  
        3. PAUSE: Always return PAUSE after an Action and wait for Observation
        4. Observation: Will contain the result of your Action (provided automatically)
        5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you have enough information
        6. Answer: Provide your final response when ready: this is mandatory

        ACTION FORMAT:
